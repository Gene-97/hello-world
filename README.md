# hello-world
First Github creation (Also dummy file)

This is the first file that I am creating and also a short introduction about myself. 

I am Eugene See, an SUTD Year 1 Freshmore going to Year 2 Sophomore, looking at joining the Engineering Systems and Design pillar. I'm currently undergoing a 14 week Summer Programme at Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities and am in the midst of a data visualisation project.
 
If anyone is interested in data analysis or data visualisation in particular, please do buzz me up through the repository. :)
